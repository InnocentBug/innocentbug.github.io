## Welcome to My World

Hey there! When I'm not busy designing Machine Learning models or coding to create better materials, I love exploring the great outdoors. My passion for water leads me on exciting kayaking adventures, discovering the hidden gems in and around Chicago and the Midwest.

## Kayaking Adventures

Here are some snapshots from my kayaking expeditions:

During these trips, we often spot a diverse array of wildlife. It's not uncommon to see night herons perched on branches, playful squirrels scampering along the shore, turtles basking in the sun, and frogs peeking out from the water's edge.

## Beautiful Lake Michigan

Lake Michigan holds a special place in my heart. Its vast expanse and ever-changing moods provide endless opportunities for stunning photographs. Here are some of my favorite shots captured over the lake:

## Beyond Nature: Lego

When I'm not out exploring nature, I enjoy spending my time building intricate Lego sets. It's a different kind of creation that allows me to exercise my creativity and problem-solving skills in a unique and non-digital way.

Pictures of our Lego sets coming soon...

I hope you enjoy this glimpse into my world of adventure and creativity!
